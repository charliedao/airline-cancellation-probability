In this phase of the project, my goal is to develop a Python script that visualizes the findings from the analysis and evaluation stage. Here's how I plan to approach it:

1. **Data Loading**: I'll start by loading the analyzed data from the CSV files that were created earlier in the analysis phase.

2. **Static Visualizations**: I'll use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create static charts. Specifically:
   - I'll construct a histogram to show the distribution of flight delay probabilities. This will help me and others understand how likely delays are within the dataset.
   - I'll create a bar chart to illustrate the average delay probabilities by airline, which will provide insights into which airlines are more prone to delays.

3. **Interactive Visualizations**: I'll also use Plotly to develop interactive charts and dashboards. These will allow for dynamic exploration of the data:
   - For example, an interactive scatter plot will help me visualize how different factors, like historical on-time performance or current conditions, impact the likelihood of delays. This will make it easier to explore various scenarios and trends.

4. **Presentation**: I'll ensure that all visualizations are clear, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to interpret. I'll use appropriate color schemes, labels, and titles to make sure the charts convey the necessary information effectively.

5. **Storage**: Finally, I'll save these visualizations in formats such as PNG or HTML and organize them in the `data/analyzed/` directory. This will make it easy to access and present them later, ensuring that the findings are well-documented and not just a collection of numbers.

This approach will help me communicate the insights from my analysis clearly and support informed decision-making based on the data.
