# Flight Schedule Optimization Project

## Project Overview

### Business Problem
The aim is to optimize flight schedules to minimize delays and improve operational efficiency for a commercial airline. Flight delays cause inconvenience to passengers, increase operational costs, and impair the airline's reputation. Reasons for delays include weather conditions, air traffic congestion, maintenance challenges, and logistical issues. Addressing this problem is expected to increase customer satisfaction, reduce costs, and provide a competitive edge. This project is driven by a personal interest in the aviation industry and a professional goal to apply data science to real-world situations with significant impact.

### Data Sets
- **Historical Flight Data**: Downloaded from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) website.
- **Weather Data**: Sourced via APIs like OpenWeatherMap or NOAA.
- **Air Traffic Data**: Available from FAA and Eurocontrol through downloadable CSV files or web scraping.
- **Maintenance Logs**: Obtained directly from airline departments or third-party providers.

### Techniques Employed
- Data extraction from external sources
- Data transformation and cleaning
- Data loading for analysis
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Data visualization

### Expected Outputs
- Cleaned and transformed data
- Predictive model and evaluation metrics
- Visualizations to support insights and decision-making
