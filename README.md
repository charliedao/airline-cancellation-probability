# Plan for Project Documentation and Data Management

# A. Code Documentation
# - Ensure all code is well-commented.
# - Add docstrings to each function for clarity.
# - Update the README.md file with the following sections:
#   - Project Overview: Describe the business problem, data sets used, techniques employed, and expected outputs.
#   - Setup Instructions: Include instructions for cloning the repository, setting up/activating the virtual environment, installing dependencies, and any other necessary setup.
#   - Running the Project: Provide steps on how to execute the project.
#   - Code Package Structure: Outline the structure of the code packages, including directories like `data/`.

# B. Data Management Assets
# - Create data dictionaries for each dataset using the provided template and save them as ‘data_dictionary_[dataset name].csv’.
# - Upload these data dictionaries into a `reference-tables` directory within `data/`.
# - Create reference tables (static .csv files) for data that doesn’t change often, e.g., state abbreviations, and upload them into `data/reference-tables/`.

# C. Part 1 Documentation Update
# - Rename 'Final Project-Part 1_[First name Last name].docx' to 'Final Project-Part 2_[First name Last name].docx'.
# - Refactor the text to reflect the current state of the project and update it from future tense.
# - Add a Change Log section at the beginning of the document, including a table with ‘Change’ and ‘Reason’ columns.
# - Include a URL to the project GitHub repo at the top of the document.

# This plan will guide the development of comprehensive project documentation and proper data management.
